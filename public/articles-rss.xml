        Not sure whether to book Swedish or deep tissue? Learn the difference,
        who each style is best for, and how to choose the right massage for
        your body.
      </description>

        <p>
          If you’ve ever stared at a menu wondering whether you need
          <strong>Swedish</strong> or <strong>deep tissue</strong> massage,
          you’re not alone. Both are full-body treatments, but they work at
          different depths and have different goals.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Swedish massage</strong> – gentle, flowing strokes to
              relax the nervous system, improve circulation, and melt away
              everyday stress.</li>
          <li><strong>Deep tissue massage</strong> – slower, more focused
              pressure aimed at stubborn tightness, knots, and chronic
              tension in the muscles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As a simple rule: choose <strong>Swedish</strong> for general
          relaxation, jet lag, or post-work stress. Choose
          <strong>deep tissue</strong> if you have intense muscle tightness,
          long hours at a desk, or nagging shoulder and back pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our therapists at <strong>Seven Angels Massage (SAM)</strong> can
          also blend both styles in one session, so you get soothing
          relaxation where you need it and deeper work where it matters.

        First time booking a hotel outcall massage in Manila or Makati?
        Here’s a simple walkthrough of how it works – from booking to
        checkout.
      </description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>
          A <strong>hotel outcall massage</strong> brings the spa straight
          to your room, so you never have to fight traffic or queue for an
          appointment. Perfect after flights, events, or long workdays.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Book your session</strong> – choose your hotel, room
              number, time, and preferred massage style.</li>
          <li><strong>Therapist arrival</strong> – your therapist arrives
              discreetly with the essentials, confirms your details, and
              sets up quickly so you can relax.</li>
          <li><strong>Session flow</strong> – you enjoy your chosen
              treatment in the comfort of your own room, with the freedom to
              shower and rest right after.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          With <strong>Seven Angels Massage (SAM)</strong>, all sessions are
          handled by professional, trained therapists who respect your
          privacy, time, and hotel rules – so your only job is to relax.

        Planning a massage around Makati’s traffic and your schedule?
        Discover the best times of day to book a mobile massage for maximum
        calm and minimal hassle.

        <p>
          Makati never really sleeps – but your body still needs rest.
          Choosing the <strong>right time to book</strong> a mobile massage
          can make the difference between a rushed session and a deeply
          restorative one.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Early evenings</strong> – perfect after work, before
              dinner or drinks, while traffic calms down.</li>
          <li><strong>Late nights</strong> – ideal for post-shift workers,
              BPO schedules, and guests heading into a reset day.</li>
          <li><strong>Weekday off-peak hours</strong> – quieter building
              hallways and faster therapist travel times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At <strong>Seven Angels Massage (SAM)</strong>, we operate
          <strong>24/7</strong>, so you can schedule a session when it fits
          your energy, your work cycle, and Makati’s traffic life.
